# A Tetrimino that is Hard Dropped Locks Down immediately. However, if a Tetrimino naturally falls
# or Soft Drops onto a Surface, it is given 0.5 seconds on a Lock Down Timer before it actually
# Locks Down. Three rulesets -Infinite Placement, Extended, and Classic- dictate the conditions
# for Lock Down. The default is Extended Placement.
#
# Extended Placement Lock Down
#   This is the default Lock Down setting.
#   Once the Tetrimino in play lands on a Surface in the Matrix, the Lock Down Timer starts counting
#   down from 0.5 seconds. Once it hits zero, the Tetrimino Locks Down and the Next Tetrimino's
#   generation phase starts. The Lock Down Timer resets to 0.5 seconds if the player simply moves
#   or rotates the Tetrimino. In Extended Placement, a Tetrimino gets 15 left/right movements or
#   rotations before it Locks Down, regardless of the time left on the Lock Down Timer. However, if
#   the Tetrimino falls one row below the lowest row yet reached, this counter is reset. In all other
#   cases, it is not reset.
#
# Infinite Placement Lock Down
#   Once the Tetrimino in play lands on a Surface in the Matrix, the Lock Down Timer starts counting
#   down from 0.5 seconds. Once it hits zero, the Tetrimino Locks Down and the Next Tetrimino's
#   generation phase starts. However, the Lock Down Timer resets to 0.5 seconds if the player simply
#   moves or rotates the Tetrimino. Thus, Infinite Placement allows the player to continue movement
#   and rotation of a Tetrimino as long as there is an actual change in its position or orientation
#   before the timer expires.
#
# Classic Lock Down
#   Classic Lock Down rules apply if Infinite Placement and Extended Placement are turned off.
#   Like Infinite Placement, the Lock Down Timer starts counting down from 0.5 seconds once the
#   Tetrimino in play lands on a Surface. The y-coordinate of the Tetrimino must decrease (i.e., the
#   Tetrimino falls further down in the Matrix) in order for the timer to be reset.

# Tetris uses a "bag" system to determine the sequence of Tetriminos that appear during game
# play. This system allows for equal distribution among the seven Tetriminos.
#
# The seven different Tetriminos are placed into a virtual bag, then shuffled into a random order.
# This order is the sequence that the bag "feeds" the Next Queue. Every time a new Tetrimino is
# generated and starts its fall within the Matrix, the Tetrimino at the front of the line in the bag is
# placed at the end of the Next Queue, pushing all Tetriminos in the Next Queue forward by one.
# The bag is refilled and reshuffled once it is empty.

# Note: In most competitive multiplayer variants, all players should receive the same order of
# Tetriminos (random for each game played), unless the variant is specifically designed not to
# do this.

# Tetriminoes will appear in the same order in games started with the same number.
# 0 means not set, and the range is from 1 to 4294967295.

# the Variable Goal System requires that the player clears 5 lines at level 1, 10 lines at
# level 2, 15 at level 3 and so on, adding an additional five lines to the Goal each level through 15.
# with the Variable Goal System of adding 5 lines per level, the player is required to clear 600 lines
# by level 15.
#
# This system also includes line bonuses to help speed up the game.
# To speed up the process of "clearing" 600 lines, in the Variable Goal System the number of Line
# Clears awarded for any action is directly based off the score of the action performed (score

# The player can perform the same actions on a Tetrimino in this phase as he/she can in the
# Falling Phase, as long as the Tetrimino is not yet Locked Down. A Tetrimino that is Hard Dropped
# Locks Down immediately. However, if a Tetrimino naturally falls or Soft Drops onto a landing
# Surface, it is given 0.5 seconds on a Lock Down Timer before it actually Locks Down.

# Combos are bonuses which rewards multiple line clears in quick succession.
# This type of combos is used in almost every official Tetris client that
# follows the Tetris Guideline. For every placed piece that clears at least one line,
# the combo counter is increased by +1. If a placed piece doesn't clear a line,
# the combo counter is reset to -1. That means 2 consecutive line clears result
# in a 1-combo, 3 consecutive line clears result in a 2-combo and so on.
# Each time the combo counter is increased beyond 0, the player receives a reward:
# In singleplayer modes, the reward is usually combo-counter*50*level points.

# A Perfect Clear (PC) means having no filled cells left after a line clear.
# Scoring:
